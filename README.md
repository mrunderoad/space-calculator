## Description

This application was made to determine a users age from their current age on 4 different planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. The user will input their age and how long they want to live and it will return how many years they have left on each planet, including earth.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Navigate to https://github.com/mrunderoad/space-calculator
* Clone the project on your local machine
* Open in VS code and install the Jest extension, the one by 'Orta'.
* Delete the package-lock.json file in the project.
* Run 'npm install' in your terminal
* Next, run 'npm run build' to get a bundled version of code accessible in the dist folder.
* Open up the space.tests.js file in the tests folder.
* If you have the Jest add on you will see green check marks or red x's next to the tests to indicate    passing or not. Alternatively/ideally you want to run 'npm run test' in the terminal to see indication of tests passing or not.  

## Known Bugs
